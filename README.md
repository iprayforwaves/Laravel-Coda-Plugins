#Laravel 4 Plugin for Coda 2.5+

For those who prefer the Coda IDE to a text editor like Sublime, a rudimentary autocomplete for Laravel 4, currently providing hinting for core Facades. 

While it provides useful hinting, it isn't a true autocomplete due to limitations in Coda with the implementation of colon (::) notation used in Laravel. Hopefully, more robust support will be forthcoming in future versions of Coda. 

More to come. Enjoy!
